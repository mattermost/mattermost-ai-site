      <description>When an open source project is new, we need speed, simplicity, and systems for feedback and iteration.
While this project is under the Mattermost umbrella, rather than using mainline communication channels like mattermost.com, mattermost.com/blog and forums.mattermost.com, we&amp;rsquo;re hosting this mini-site for the Mattermost AI Framework inside of the repository itself for developers, data engineers, and our AI/ML technical community.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t a best practice, and it isn&amp;rsquo;t scalable in the long run, and it may irk some purists reading through our commit history.</description>
