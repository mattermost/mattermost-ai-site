When an open source project is new, we need speed, simplicity and systems for feedback and iteration,

While this project is under the Mattermost umbrella, rather than using mainline channels like `mattermost.com`, `mattermost.com/blog` and `forums.mattermost.com`, we're going to host a mini-site for the Mattermost AI Framework inside of the repository itself for developers, data engineers, and our AI/ML technical community.

This isn't a best practice, and it isn't scalable in the long run, and it may irk some purists reading through our commit history,

However, it's how the Mattermost open source project was run in its earliest days, and has some key advantages:

1 - Speed - We can update and iterate on our techincal content in docs, site and blog super fast. We may ship more typos this way, but we can fix them quickly too,

2 - Discoverability - All the technical information goes into one place, and in the repo itself. When we announce something to the blog, our repo community will actually get it pushed to their own code bases, rather than hoping they'll get an email, Tweet, LinkedIn post, blog reader, etc.

3 - Feedback - As part of our repo, every update to our site and docs is available for comment and critique. We WANT to hear from our community, and if there's anything you have feedback about, you can literally point to the exact line in our site and discuss it.

4 - Iteration - The most powerful focus in open source is iteration. With speed, discoverability and feedback, we can iterate quickly with better information about how to server our community and stakeholders.

5 - Transparency - With all this happening fast, there's the added benefit of seeing everything as it changes through our commit history. Everything's out in the open and our community can watch through PR threads our intention, implementation, community feedback, decisions and reasoning.

We realize there's issues with this approach, including cluttering the commit history, fragmenting our SEO, having multiple blogs, among other factors--and in the fullness of time, we will integrate with docs.mattermost.com, mattermost.com, mattermost.com/blog and other mainline channels,

However in the early days of an open source project, when speed, discoverability, feedback, iteration and transparency are key to building trust, momentum and a strong sense of community, we can live with the cons for a little while.
