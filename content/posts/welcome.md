When an open source project is new, we need speed, simplicity, and systems for feedback and iteration.

While this project is under the Mattermost umbrella, rather than using mainline communication channels like `mattermost.com`, `mattermost.com/blog` and `forums.mattermost.com`, we're hosting this mini-site for the Mattermost AI Framework inside of the repository itself for developers, data engineers, and our AI/ML technical community.

This isn't a best practice, and it isn't scalable in the long run, and it may irk some purists reading through our commit history. However, it's how the Mattermost open source project was run in its earliest days, and has 5 key advantages:

1. **Speed** - We can update and iterate on our techincal content in our documentation, on our site, and on our blog very quickly. We may ship more typos this way, but we can fix them quickly too.

2. **Discoverability** - All the technical information lives in one place, and in the repository itself. When we announce something new through the blog, our repository community will actually get it pushed to their own code bases, rather than hoping they'll get an email, Tweet, LinkedIn post, blog reader update, and so on.

3. **Feedback** - As part of our repository, every update to our site and documentation is available for comment and critique. We WANT to hear from our community, and if there's anything you have feedback about, you can literally point to the exact line in our site and discuss it with us.

4. **Iteration** - The most powerful focus in open source is iteration. With speed, discoverability, and feedback, we can iterate quickly with better information about how to serve our community and stakeholders.

5. **Transparency** - With all this happening so fast, there's the added benefit of seeing everything as it changes through our commit history. Everything's out in the open, and through pull request threads, our community can watch our intentions, implementation, community feedback, decisions, and reasoning.

We realize there's issues with this approach, including cluttering the commit history, fragmenting our SEO, and having multiple blogs, among other factors -- and in the fullness of time, we will integrate with [docs.mattermost.com](https://docs.mattermost.com/), [mattermost.com](https://mattermost.com/), [mattermost.com/blog](https://mattermost.com/blog/) and other mainline communication channels.

During the early days of an open source project, where speed, discoverability, feedback, iteration and transparency are key to building trust, momentum, and a strong sense of community, we can live with the cons for a little while.
