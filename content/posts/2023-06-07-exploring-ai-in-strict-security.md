Mattermost recently announced the release of a reference architecture for its new open source “Private AI” stack with `mattermost-ai-framework`. The stack provides a flexible, scalable, self-hosted platform for team messaging with both colleagues and AI bots across web, desktop and mobile powered by an interchangeable array of open source large language models (LLMs) to accelerate exploration, testing and development of AI-enhanced workflows while maintaining full data control of user conversations, prompts and AI responses and models.

The offering is built for technical teams in defense, government and technology organizations tasked to explore new generative AI technologies, but unable to use public AI services, due to requirements to keep confidential information–including queries and conversational histories–within their approved infrastructure. 

“Technology leaders in strict security environments are in urgent need of options to understand and assess the latest advances in AI,” said Ian Tien, Mattermost CEO. “To meet these needs, Mattermost is open sourcing a multi-user conversational AI stack powered by interchangeable open source AI models that can be deployed to private clouds and data centers--or even run on a laptop--to support collaborative, AI-enhanced workflows across web, desktop and mobile experiences.”

The new platform has an array of benefits for technical teams including: 

- Conversational summarization of multi-user discussion threads enables assessment of different self-hosted, open source AI models to summarize domain-specific discussions while keeping all test data and outputs within your organization’s control.

- Multi-user AI bot discussion enables collaborative questioning, prompting and answering in real-time discussions for users to assess, iterate and evaluate responses of multiple agents connected to different LLM models. 

- “Collaborative AI” across web, desktop and mobile with users and AI bots interacting in conversations and workflows, with all user and AI data contained within private cloud infrastructure. 

- Scalable AI model architecture enabling deployment into private clouds and data centers on high-powered hardware to use larger models, as well as the ability to run on hardware as small as a conventional laptop. 

- Fully transparent and controlled research environment with access to all open source components with the ability to extend or modify any part of the stack or integrations. 

In contrast to earlier generative AI models requiring hundreds of servers, thousands of gigabytes of storage and memory, and specialized hardware using graphical processing units (GPUs) manufactured by companies like Nvidia, the `mattermost-ai-framework` uses new open source technologies that can scale down a new generation of AI models to install and run on commodity laptops, with as little as 16 gigabytes of memory and less than 5 gigabytes of storage space.

The new framework is an initial release in a series of reference architectures Mattermost intends to open source to accelerate the development of AI-enhanced collaboration in strict security environments for defense, government and technology organizations. 

“While open source LLMs are in their infancy, we see them on course to materially accelerate technical collaboration and workflows,” adds Tien. “They’ll increase the attention and focus on our most impactful discussions, while reducing the drudgery and distraction of sifting through our daily information flows. We believe enterprises need to have feasible options for running both public and private AI services, and both proprietary and open source models. Eventually, we’ll extend this new framework to offer proprietary AI services as well–which currently lead the market. Our intent with today’s announcement is offering a new path to private and open AI innovation.”
