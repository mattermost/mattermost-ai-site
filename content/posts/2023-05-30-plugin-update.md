We are thrilled to announce an update to our [`mattermost-plugin-ai`](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-ai)! This release brings a fresh new interface and enhancements to improve your experience with the AI Assistant. Let's explore the details:

✨ **New Interface for the AI Assistant**: Say hello to our revamped AI Assistant interface! We have given it a makeover to provide a more better user experience.

🤖 **Renamed as AI Assistant**: We have renamed the LLM Bot to AI Assistant for better clarity. Now, you can easily call upon the AI Assistant by mentioning `@ai` instead of `@llmbot`.

🎨 **Updated Profile Icon**: The AI Assistant now sports a brand new profile icon, giving it a fresh and distinctive look.

👍👎 **Enhanced Feedback Reactions**: The thumbs-up and thumbs-down reactions have received a visual improvement and send feedback to the AI Assistant.

🔠 **Font Reverted to Regular**: We have reverted from using a monospaced font to a regular font. However, don't worry! We are working on introducing additional controls to differentiate the AI Assistant from regular users so there is no confusion.

AI open source technologies continue to evolve, empowering us to create intelligent and collaborative tools that augment human capabilities. Let's embrace the potential of AI and open source to shape a future where intelligent assistants empower us to achieve greater productivity and success.
